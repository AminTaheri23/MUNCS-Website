  <h1>A Force-Start into Game Development</h1>
<p>By Simanto Rahman</p>
<p>Game Development. That is like music to my ears.
Unlike other sectors of Computer Industry, Game Development Industry is more volatile and indie based; now more than ever.</p>
<p>This article is gonna be about the Modern Game Industry and the tools you might need to know about in order to get started.</p>
<h2>Game Engine</h2>
<p>A Game Engine is a software (set of toolsets) aimed to provide a developer with all the tools required to develop a fully functioning game. In a way its an IDE for game devs.
A game engine combines several types of functionalities required for game development; <strong>logic and scripting, visual rendering, sound and (ofcourse) Graphical User Interface</strong>.
Currently there are so many game engines, that its hard to keep track. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_game_engines">This</a> might give you some idea.
My personal favourite is <a href="http://www.unity3d.com/">Unity GameEngine</a>.
It is the most used game engine currently (with good reasons).
I won’t go into why this is a good place to start learning.
But one major reason is it is free (but they’ll keep a unity3d logo at the start of the game for the free version).
It comes with all the tools you’d need to create a game; 2D and 3D.
It uses C# as its weapon of choice for coding. Another factor to know is that unity is script based.
So each class is a script and treated a separate file or <strong>component</strong>.</p>
<h2>3D Creation Suite</h2>
<p>Softwares that are used to create, modify and texture 3D models and assets fall under this category.
This includes software applications like (Autodesk) <strong>Maya, AutoCAD</strong> and <strong>Blender</strong>.
These three are the most popular ones currently (and for good reasons).
All three support 3D models creation, animation and rendering.
Rendering is a vital part of game development because it is a part of the graphical workflow.
If you are making games, chances are, you are rendering your own materials and textures to optimize the game.
More of that in the coming posts.</p>
<p>Among these my personal favourite is <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>.
Blender is an open source software that is up and coming.
A huge chunk of Game Devs already adapted to blender and they are happy with the decision.
Blender is a multi-purpose 3D Creation Suite which can be used from simple things like 3D asset creation, to video editing, rendering scenes and even sound manipulation (WOW!).
I strictly use blender to create and modify 3D assets, as well as creating materials out of it that look good inside Unity3D.</p>
<h2>IDE/Script Editor</h2>
<p>Next up is a proper environment for Scripting. Unity3D is pretty close to Microsoft.
Microsoft works hand in hand to make Unity3D work beautifully on the Windows platforms (and also with NVIDIA graphics cards).
So it shouldn’t be a surprise to know that Unity Editor works well with <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/">Visual Studio Community</a> (and Visual Studio Mac, but not as much as Community).
VS Community is a fully featured IDE. It is powerful, supports almost <em>EVERYTHING</em>.
It is hard to find something that it can’t work with. The integration is flawless and deep.
But beware; VS Community is a heavy software with over 30GB of functionalities with a load time of a turtle.</p>
<p>Recently I was introduced to a script editor called <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> (don’t be alarmed, it is Open Source).
Yes you saw it right; open source. Even though it is called <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>.
I fell in love with this thing as soon as I started using it. It is a fully functioning script editor with modular components.
So it comes as a script editor when you download it, then you can add components to it like debugger for a specific compiler, auto-complete for different languages and even platform specific auto-complete modules are available (sweet!).
It is available in most major operating systems including Windows, (Linux)Ubuntu and MacOS. Plus uncountable number of themes!
This makes it a step forward from a script editor but not an entire IDE either.</p>
<p><em>Oh by the way</em>, it also comes with a built-in git management system for all your needs.</p>
<p>SO! If you are interested in game development, connect with people, go through Youtube.
Find your passion in it. Make something… Astonishing!</p>
